First thing first is dataset. 

Nothing will work without dataset. 
So lets create one!
Starting CSGO, press GO then Win+Alt+R and recording is strarted.
Played the game, we lose, crap...
But at least we have the video. 
Now need to cut it into frames, so let use incredible vlc media player.
Just setup scene video filter and crop filter and convert the video. 
In the folder we have over thousand 100 by 100 images cropped around the crosshair.

Now the lables are required.
Calling to mind tkinter and making an image clicker and just clicking heads on images(if they are there)
[x cord, y cord, 1(as a probability of head existence)] for images withou head: [0, 0, 0].
The code is in "dataset_creator.py".

Now the hard part, neural network...

I decided to use 3 convolutional layers without pooling and 2 liner layers after them, so the network will have 1 input chanel and 3 outputs.
For convolutional layer is used ReLU activation function and for linear sigmoid. Mean Squer Error is used as the loss function and Adam optimizer for optimization
Code is in "detector.py"

Note: for running the trained model code "runner.py" is used
